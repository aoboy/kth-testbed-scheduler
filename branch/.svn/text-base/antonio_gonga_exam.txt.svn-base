Q1: 
A1: A company that does not innovate or bring in new products cannot survive 
in nowadays competitive world. For example, google started with the search engine
which was a brillant idea on that time, however, it needed other products to keep
up with the rise of Yahoo Search and MSN Search. To confront the competitors and 
defent its market share, Google innovated
itself, while it also brought in new products such as productivity tools, 
mobile software, google maps, cloud computing, etc.


Q2:
A2: Open inovation focus on using valuable ideas comming inside and outside a company.
These ideas can go to market from inside or outside the company.
For example Cisco, had or still have a small R&D team and budget compared to Xerox,
however, Cisco profited more from external ideas comming from Xerox compared to
Xerox heavy investiment in R&D. This demonstrates that, unlike Xerox, Cisco
took advatage of Xerox ideas by using Open innovation approach is its management
style.(from Open Innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology).

Q4:
A4: Efficiency means doing things in the right way, while effectiviness means
doing the right things. 
Over time, efficiency has an exponential increase at the beguining, while it later 
increases smothly and assimptotically. On the other hand, effectiviness, starts 
at the highest level, and decreases almost exponentially and the beguining, and 
tends to zero as the time elapses. 

Q5:
A5: Running a IPR background study prior to starting a R&D project allows a 
company not only to prevent patent infringments, but also it allows to get a 
broader view which competitors/other reaserch have been developed on the topic.
It also allows to inform the company which companies/organizations can we make 
partnership/alliance with.

Q6:
A6: When developing a new product, the R&D group work together with the marketing
group which will market the new product, the sales group that will sell it to the
customers, with the manufactuing group that will produce it, with the managent
that if the need it requires will rise money to ensure that the new product reaches the
market, the environment and legal groups that study the regulatory status...etc.


Q7:
A7: Successful joint-ventures and strategic alliances have the following characteristics:
(1) Their differences and well understood and respected.
(2) Each company/partner makes complementary contributions.
(3) They share cultural values
(4) They have similar and consistent management styles.

Q8:
A8:A VOT it is not a technical description of a product, it is instead, a map that
describes a product in a broader view. This includes the product name itself, the 
method of manufacture, the strengths of our product as well as the product 
weaknesses. This also informs which threats our product will have, as well as the 
IPR, and the regulatory status. It also describes which companies are our main competitors,
and which companies provide us with the necessary means to manufacture our product.


Q9:
A9:The thrid and fourth generation R&D are more effective in creating
commercial vaule because they incorporate a set of characterists then innexistent
in the 1st and the 2nd generation. For example, in the 4th, uses open innovation
which allows a company to use valuable internal and external ideas to create a new set of products.
There is a sense of urgency, and well as, there is fast recognition of unmet customer needs.

Q10:
A10: Familiarity Matrix is the "process of mapping R&D projects based on the
extent of knowledge about technologies and markets".
The Familiarity matrix helps a company to understand the success or the risk of failure of a product.
In cases of an unfamiliar markets and unfamiliar technologies, a careful study of
the FM prevents a company from falling into the suicide square. This box/squqre represents
a product with almost 0% success in the market. 

Q11:
A11:When signing a contract, a special attention must be paid for to the following items:
(1) rights to results, (2) confidentiality obligations, (3) warantees, (4) publication,
(5) restrictions, and (6) rights to use.

Q12:
A12:Value preposition is the leverage a company have in order to sell the product that is proposing to
a segment of the market. It includes a set of features/advantages of the new product to its custmers/users
that makes them to adopt the new product(yours) instead of the old ones or from other competitors.
A market segment is a set of(or group of) custmers that a company targets with a product(specific or not).
A market segment can be specialized if the customer needs are specific, or need to be reached through specific
channels. For example Daimler-Benz produces MaiBach for a very specific market segement (very rich) whose
needs include cars with status and not costing less than 200K USDollars.

Q13:
A13:Established companies have many ways to conter an emerging company.
For example, if the new company products depends on products of the established
companies, they can require extra licensing. They can also sue the new company just to avoid
investors investing on the new company.
They also can do market dumping, i.e sell their products at prices well-below the
market price to put your company out the market in a short time. They can afford losing money,
however, the goal is to guarantee that your company does not survive in the market, so that
they can still maintain their dominating position without any new competitor.

Q14:
A14: Stage-gate control allows from a set of initial ideas, to sort at the most feasible
ones thatb should progress into the next stage gate. It allows for example to refine
a product/projects so that the most likely to attain a commercial success are selected for the
next stage.


Q15:
A15: The components that go into evaluating projects in portfolio analysis are:
(1) technical success, (2) commercial success, (3) reward, (4) business leverage,
and (5) strategic fit. For example, if a company wants to have a strategic advantage
over its competitors, the study of a company's portfolio analysis would recommend
the company to increase its investiment in R&D.
